    "This notebook establishes an SSH tunnel to the Kaggle VM using ngrok, allowing remote development via VS Code/Cursor Remote-SSH extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Kaggle Secrets** configured in Account Settings:\n",
    "   - `DVC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`: Google Service Account JSON\n",
    "   - `WANDB_API_KEY`: Weights & Biases API key\n",
    "   - `NGROK_TOKEN`: ngrok authentication token\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **GPU** enabled for this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Internet** enabled for this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run all cells in order\n",
    "2. Copy the SSH command and password from Cell 4 output\n",
    "3. Connect via SSH from your local machine (password is randomly generated per session)\n",
    "4. Or use VS Code/Cursor Remote-SSH extension\n",
    "5. Keep this notebook running throughout your training session\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security Note\n",
    "\n",
    "- SSH password is **randomly generated** each session for security\n",
    "- Save the password from Cell 4 output immediately\n",
    "- Password changes every time you restart the notebook\n"
